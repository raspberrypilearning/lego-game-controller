## What next?

### Improve the Pong game

Add even more randomness to the speed and trajectory fo the ball.

Have the ball moves faster as the game progresses.

Right now the game carries on forever - have a target score that a player must achieve inn order to win and then start a new set of rounds. 

Introduce some haptic feedback, so that the motors turn a small amlount when a point is lost.

At the moment it doesn't matter what part of the paddle connects with the ball, it will always bounce off at the same angle  as it hit. Modify the collision code so that the angle becomes more obtuse if the ball makes contact close to the end of the paddle. 

### Create more games that use the LEGO motors as controllers.

How about a game in the style of Angry Birds where two controllers are used to set the launch trajectory and the amount of force applied to the catapult?
