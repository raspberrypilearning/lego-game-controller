## Introduction

In this project you will use the Raspberry Pi BuildHAT, a LEGO Spike motor encoder and wheel, and the Python Turtle library to make a simple game controller that you can use to play pong.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)</span> is one of the earliest arcade video games, originally released in 1972 by Atari. It is a table tennis game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Players control paddles on each side of the screen, which they use to hit a ball back and forth.

You will:
- learn how to read the degrees of rotation from LEGO Spike motor encoders
- learn to draw and move Turtle graphics using LEGO Spike motor encoders
- learn to detect collisions between graphics using `x` and `y` coordinates

### You will need

+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ A Raspberry Pi Build HAT
+ At least one LEGO Spike motor
+ Assortment of LEGO, including wheels. We used a selection from the [LEGO Spike Prime kit](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/spike-prime)
+ A small breadboard (optional)
+ A Buzzer (optional)
+ Some breadboard jumper leads (optional)
+ A 7.5v power supply with a barrel jack (optional). You can use an official Raspberry Pi power supply for this project, as the motor encoders will not be using any power.

### Software

+ Python 3
+ Build HAT Python library
